# intel-ayc-early2012
Submission by Sebastian Eder and me for the intel Accelerate Your Code (AYC) contest.

The final submission for parallelizing the original program provided in /ayc-original/ can be found in /ayc-pthread-nopack/. It contains the source code as well as a description of our approach.

In addition, we also explored alternative approaches using:
- OpenMP:  /ayc-openmp/
- 'Packing', i.e., encoding/decoding sequences before/after comparison, in /ayc-pack/
